Environment frame (conceptually):
- hashmap from symbol to value and flags
- parent frame
- recyclable flag
- invocation context

Flags:
- constant

First implementation with hashmaps everywhere, then:

environment frame indexable by offset:
- object header
- parent frame
- shape (eg hashmap from symbol to object)
- flags
  - recyclable (= can be returned to freelist on activation frame return)
  - shape shared (= COW for shape)
  - constant flags for first 8 slots
- size (32bit)
- page_directory
- page_constant flags
- invocation context kind
- invocation context data
- slots[8]

If 8 < size <= 72 then page_directory points directly to page of at most 64 slots
- allocation of the page follows progression:
   16 (same size as frame => same freelist), 32, 64
If 72 < size then:
  - page_directory points to vector of page pointers
    - pages are always allocated for 64 slots
  - page_constant points to vector of constant flags bitfields
    (or NULL if there are no constants)
